text
    Text to be displayed on the page. Allows arbitrary number of commands,
    which will be joined into a single string seperated by spaces.

header
    Like text, but renders as a large, bold header.

divider
    Inserts a seperator on the page. (Renders an <hr> element).

inline
    All subcommands to this are rendered on one line (sets display to inline-
    block for all child elements).

widget
    A collection of commands to be called elsewhere. Whenever a widget is
    called as a command, the display list behaves as though its subcommands
    were inserted at the location of the call.
    
    Widgets may have any alphanumeric name (that are not reserved), but are
    capitalized by convention.

foreach
    Repeats subcommands for every item in a list.

newline
    Inserts a blank line here.

center
    Center rendered subcommands.

rightjustify
    Right-justifies rendered subcommands

include
    Inserts another display list at this point. Useful for libraries of widgets.
